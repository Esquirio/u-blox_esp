- Using Wi-Fi 6
- NORA-W4 transmits data periodically via TCP link:
    - 300bytes each 30s and
    - 2k each 5min
- NORA-W4 receives data aperiodically via TCP link:
    - 4x2.5k (Total 10k) [ESP32 Buffer limit = 4k]
- TCP Server was created on the [TCP Debugger app](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NWV1TCX232T?hl=en-us&gl=US).
    - Also, it was tested using the YAT software.
- The module is set up to be online and responds to ping anytime.

# Results

We ran different tests modifying the TWT service period.

## TWT service period: 524.288 ms

- Test duration: 5 min
- TWT service period: 524.288 ms
- Current average: 12.54 mA

# Conclusions

- TWT service period is 4 s or up issues:
- Affects the task of receiving the 2.5k data from the TCP server.
    - Maybe it could be solved if we split the data into small packages.
- Disconnects the initial TCP link:

![TWT 4s issue](images/NORA_W4_twt_4s.png)

- Creates a new TCP link and keeps transmitting data

If the time constraints of the system are flexible (Soft Real-time system) and/or if the customer wants to transfer small data packets, it is possible to increase the TWT service period and test scenarios where the current consumption could reach lower levels.

Similar to the previous scenario, but without the receiving feature.
